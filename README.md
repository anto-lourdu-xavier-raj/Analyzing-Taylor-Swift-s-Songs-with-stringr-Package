# In this R programming activity, the focus is on manipulating character strings using the stringr package. The dataset used contains information about Taylor Swift's songs, including variables such as track name, YouTube video title, video duration, and full song lyrics. Participants learn to match strings using functions like str_detect(), count occurrences with str_count(), and modify strings using functions like str_sub() and str_replace_all(). This covers handling inconsistent capitalization and spacing, and concludes with creating a word cloud representing the frequencies of words in Taylor Swift's song lyrics using the tidytext and wordcloud2 packages.
